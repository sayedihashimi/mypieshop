Before I draft the specifications, let me gather some important details to ensure we build exactly what you need.Great! I can see you already have a project started with pie images and data. Now let me ask some clarifying questions to create the right specifications:\n\n## Project Setup & Technology\n\n1. **React Setup**: Do you want to:\n   - Use **Vite** (modern, fast)\n   - Use **Create React App** (classic)\n   - Use **Next.js** (if you want server-side rendering)\n   - Or something else?\n\n2. **Styling Approach**: What's your preference?\n   - Plain CSS\n   - CSS Modules\n   - Tailwind CSS\n   - Styled Components\n   - Bootstrap/Material-UI\n   - Or just something simple and clean?\n\n## Features & Behavior\n\n3. **Pie Data**: I see you have `src/images/pies.json`. Should the website:\n   - Use this existing JSON file directly?\n   - Should I move it to a more appropriate location in the React project structure?\n\n4. **Shopping Cart Persistence**: Should the cart:\n   - Persist across browser sessions (using localStorage)?\n   - Reset when the page refreshes?\n\n5. **Checkout Form**: For the credit card/contact info form, should it:\n   - Just validate that fields are filled in (mock validation)?\n   - Include real-looking validation (email format, card number format)?\n   - No validation at all?\n\n6. **Navigation**: Do you want:\n   - A header/nav bar on all pages?\n   - What should be the overall layout/structure?\n\n## Design & Content\n\n7. **Visual Style**: What tone/feel do you want?\n   - Modern and clean\n   - Rustic/homey (traditional pie shop feel)\n   - Upscale/elegant\n   - Fun and playful\n   - Just functional (focus on features, not design)\n\n8. **About Page Content**: Should I:\n   - Generate completely fictitious content about Southside Pie Shop (history, location, story)?\n   - Keep it minimal as a placeholder for you to customize later?\n\nOnce I understand these details, I'll create comprehensive feature specifications that will guide the implementation perfectly!",

Let me manually create the necessary files for a Vite + React project:Now let's create the basic React app structure in `src/frontend`:I need to create the directory first:Perfect! Now let's install the dependencies. Let me try using a different approach to bypass the npm issue:Excellent! Now let's test that the basic app works:Perfect! The dev server is running. Let me stop it and continue with the setup:Great! **Task 1.1 ✅ Complete** - Vite + React project initialized and verified working.\n\nNow let's move to **Task 1.2: Install and configure Tailwind CSS**:Tailwind installed successfully, but npx failed. Let me manually create the config files:Now update the index.css to include Tailwind directives:Perfect! **Task 1.2 ✅ Complete** - Tailwind CSS installed and configured with rustic color palette.\n\nNow **Task 1.3: Install React Router**:Excellent! **Task 1.3 ✅ Complete** - React Router installed.\n\nNow **Task 1.4: Set up project folder structure**. Let me create all the necessary directories:Perfect! **Task 1.4 ✅ Complete** - Project folder structure created.\n\nNow **Task 1.5: Move pies.json and images to the new locations**:Excellent! **Task 1.5 ✅ Complete** - pies.json and all images moved to frontend directories.\n\nLet me verify everything is in place and test the setup:Perfect! Now let's test that everything still works. Let me update the App.jsx to use Tailwind classes:Now let's test the dev server to verify Phase 1 is complete:Perfect! 🎉 **Phase 1 Complete!**\n\n## Summary - Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration ✅\n\nAll tasks completed successfully:\n- ✅ **1.1** - Vite + React project initialized\n- ✅ **1.2** - Tailwind CSS installed and configured with rustic color palette\n- ✅ **1.3** - React Router installed\n- ✅ **1.4** - Complete project folder structure created\n- ✅ **1.5** - pies.json and all 16 pie images moved to `src/frontend/`\n\n**Verification:** Dev server runs successfully at http://localhost:5175/ with Tailwind styling working.\n\n**Next Stage:** Phase 2 - Layout & Navigation (Header, Footer, Layout component, and React Router setup)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with Phase 2, or would you like to verify Phase 1 first by running the dev server?",
