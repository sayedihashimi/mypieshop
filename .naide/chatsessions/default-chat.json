I want the website to have a home page that shows all the pies along with the price and a purchase button with shopping cart support. In addition to the home page I want to create the following pages.\n\n- About - on this page I want you to make up some things for this fictitious pie shop\n- Shopping cart - shows the items in the cart along with a button to buy\n- Buy screen - take the users contact info along with credit card details. When they click buy, just present an order submitted page/content.",

Before I draft the specifications, let me gather some important details to ensure we build exactly what you need.Great! I can see you already have a project started with pie images and data. Now let me ask some clarifying questions to create the right specifications:\n\n## Project Setup & Technology\n\n1. **React Setup**: Do you want to:\n   - Use **Vite** (modern, fast)\n   - Use **Create React App** (classic)\n   - Use **Next.js** (if you want server-side rendering)\n   - Or something else?\n\n2. **Styling Approach**: What's your preference?\n   - Plain CSS\n   - CSS Modules\n   - Tailwind CSS\n   - Styled Components\n   - Bootstrap/Material-UI\n   - Or just something simple and clean?\n\n## Features & Behavior\n\n3. **Pie Data**: I see you have `src/images/pies.json`. Should the website:\n   - Use this existing JSON file directly?\n   - Should I move it to a more appropriate location in the React project structure?\n\n4. **Shopping Cart Persistence**: Should the cart:\n   - Persist across browser sessions (using localStorage)?\n   - Reset when the page refreshes?\n\n5. **Checkout Form**: For the credit card/contact info form, should it:\n   - Just validate that fields are filled in (mock validation)?\n   - Include real-looking validation (email format, card number format)?\n   - No validation at all?\n\n6. **Navigation**: Do you want:\n   - A header/nav bar on all pages?\n   - What should be the overall layout/structure?\n\n## Design & Content\n\n7. **Visual Style**: What tone/feel do you want?\n   - Modern and clean\n   - Rustic/homey (traditional pie shop feel)\n   - Upscale/elegant\n   - Fun and playful\n   - Just functional (focus on features, not design)\n\n8. **About Page Content**: Should I:\n   - Generate completely fictitious content about Southside Pie Shop (history, location, story)?\n   - Keep it minimal as a placeholder for you to customize later?\n\nOnce I understand these details, I'll create comprehensive feature specifications that will guide the implementation perfectly!",

Make the location Shartlesville, PA.\n\nIn the folder `src/images` I have images of all the pies, look at `src/images/pies.json` for the name and price of all the pies.",
