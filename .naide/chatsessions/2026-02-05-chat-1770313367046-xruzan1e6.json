When I run an npm app, when I click the Stop button the log file shows that the app is stopped but the UI remains and I can still interact with the web app. When I click close again the in-app browser shows the not running state. I think we are not properly stopping the entire node/npm processes. It looks like the processes are still running after I close Naide.",
